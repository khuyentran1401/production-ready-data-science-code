# Modular Design

Compare monolithic vs modular code approaches to see why breaking large files into focused modules improves maintainability.

## Files

- `monolithic/main.py` - All functionality in one file (70+ lines)
- `modular/` - Same functionality split across focused modules
  - `process.py` - Data loading and preprocessing
  - `train_model.py` - Model training and evaluation
  - `main.py` - Workflow coordination

## Key Points

- Focused modules make code easier to navigate and test
- Modular design improves reusability and team collaboration

## How to Run

```bash
# Monolithic approach
cd monolithic && uv run main.py

# Modular approach  
cd modular && uv run main.py
```

## Expected Output

Both approaches produce the same results, but modular is easier to maintain.

## Try This

1. **Compare file sizes**: Notice how modular breaks down complexity
2. **Test individual modules**: Import functions from modular version
3. **Add new features**: See which approach is easier to extend
