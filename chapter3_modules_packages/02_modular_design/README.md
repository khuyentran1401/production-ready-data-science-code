# Modular Design: Monolithic vs Modular Approach

This example demonstrates the difference between **monolithic** and **modular** code design approaches, showing why breaking down large files into smaller, focused modules improves code maintainability.

## The Problem: Monolithic Code

Large files with multiple responsibilities become difficult to:
- Navigate and understand
- Test individual components  
- Maintain and modify safely
- Reuse in other projects
- Collaborate on with team members

## The Solution: Modular Design

Breaking code into focused modules provides:
- **Clear separation of concerns**
- **Improved code organization**
- **Better testability and maintainability**
- **Enhanced reusability**
- **Easier team collaboration**

## Examples in This Directory

### üìÅ [monolithic/](monolithic/)
**Single file containing all functionality**
- All functions in one `main.py` file
- Mixed responsibilities (data processing, model training, evaluation)
- Demonstrates problems with monolithic approach

**Run it:**
```bash
cd monolithic
uv run main.py
```

### üìÅ [modular/](modular/)
**Same functionality split across focused modules**
- `process.py` - Data loading and preprocessing
- `train_model.py` - Model training and evaluation  
- `main.py` - Workflow coordination
- Demonstrates benefits of modular design

**Run it:**
```bash
cd modular
uv run main.py
```

## Key Learning Points

### Before (Monolithic)
‚ùå **70+ lines in single file** - Hard to navigate
‚ùå **Mixed responsibilities** - Data processing, training, evaluation all together
‚ùå **Difficult to test** - Can't easily test individual components
‚ùå **Poor reusability** - Functions tied to specific file context

### After (Modular)
‚úÖ **Focused modules** - Each file has clear, single responsibility
‚úÖ **Easy navigation** - Find data processing in `process.py`, training in `train_model.py`
‚úÖ **Better testing** - Test each module independently
‚úÖ **High reusability** - Import functions in other projects
‚úÖ **Team friendly** - Multiple developers can work on different modules
