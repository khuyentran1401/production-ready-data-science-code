# Production-Ready Data Science Code Repository

## Repository Overview

This repository contains code examples from **"Production-Ready Data Science"** by Khuyen Tran. It demonstrates best practices for transitioning from prototyping to production-ready data science systems through practical, runnable examples.

## Project Structure & Educational Organization

The repository is organized as a companion to the book with chapter-specific directories containing complete, functional examples:


## Example Creation Guidelines
When creating educational examples, keep them focused and minimal:

- **Focus on the core concept**: Strip away unnecessary code that doesn't demonstrate the main point
- **Minimize data creation**: Use simple variables instead of complex DataFrames or when possible
- **Reduce print statements**: Show only what's needed to demonstrate the concept
- **Avoid object instantiation**: Don't create objects unless they're essential to the demonstration
- **Demonstrate through comparison**: Show the problem clearly without excessive explanation

## Key Repository Insights

- **Educational Focus**: All code serves as teaching examples, not production systems
- **UV-Centric**: Uses UV package manager throughout for consistency
- **Modular Teaching**: Each concept isolated in its own runnable example
- **Production Readiness**: Examples demonstrate transition from prototype to production patterns
