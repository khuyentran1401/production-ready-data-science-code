# Chapter 14: Notebooks in Production

## Problem

Traditional Jupyter notebooks suffer from hidden state, execution order dependencies, and variable redefinition issues that make them unreliable for production use. Teams struggle with notebooks that work for one person but fail for others, results that can't be reproduced, and analysis that breaks when cells are run out of order.

## Examples

- [01_basic_marimo_notebook/](01_basic_marimo_notebook/) - Introduction to marimo structure
- [02_dependency_tracking/](02_dependency_tracking/) - Automatic cell re-execution
- [03_data_analysis_workflow/](03_data_analysis_workflow/) - Complete data science workflow
- [04_testing_notebook/](04_testing_notebook/) - Testable notebook functions
- [05_variable_redefinition_error/](05_variable_redefinition_error/) - Variable redefinition prevention

## Setup

```bash
uv sync --group chapter14
```

## Why This Matters

Production-ready notebooks with automatic dependency tracking and deterministic execution enable reliable, reproducible data science workflows that teams can trust and deploy.
