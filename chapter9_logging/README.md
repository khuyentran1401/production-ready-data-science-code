# Chapter 9: Logging

## Problem

Data science applications often fail silently in production, leaving teams to debug issues with only cryptic error messages or print statements scattered throughout code. Without proper logging, it's impossible to monitor model performance, trace data pipeline failures, or understand what happened when ML systems break.

## Why This Matters

Structured logging enables observability in production ML systems, faster debugging, and proactive monitoring of data pipelines and model performance.
