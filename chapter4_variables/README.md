# Chapter 4: Variables

## Problem

Data science code often suffers from cryptic variable names (`df2`, `model_v3`, `temp_result`), unclear data types, and memory inefficiency with large datasets. Poor variable management makes code unreadable, debugging difficult, and collaboration frustrating. Proper naming, typing, and memory management create maintainable, professional code.

## Why This Matters

Clear variable management reduces bugs, improves team collaboration, and makes data science code maintainable at scale.
